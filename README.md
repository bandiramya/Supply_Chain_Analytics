# Supply_Chain_Analytics_Project

This repository contains the code, data, and report for the Supply Chain Analytics Project, which focuses on optimizing supply chain performance using advanced data analytics techniques.

## Project Overview
In this project, we analyze a supply chain dataset to gain insights into supplier performance, inventory turnover, cost efficiency, and demand forecasting. The project demonstrates various data analysis techniques, machine learning models, and optimization methods to improve overall supply chain management.

## Key Objectives:
Forecast product demand using machine learning.
Optimize inventory levels to minimize holding and ordering costs.
Segment suppliers based on performance and cost efficiency.
Provide recommendations to enhance supply chain operations.

## Technologies Used
Python for data analysis and machine learning.
Pandas for data manipulation.
NumPy for mathematical calculations.
Scikit-learn for machine learning algorithms.
Matplotlib & Seaborn for data visualization.

## Data
The dataset includes information on product types, sales, stock levels, lead times, supplier performance, and costs. The key features analyzed are:

Product details: SKU, price, availability.
Inventory metrics: Number of products sold, stock levels.
Supplier metrics: Lead times, defect rates, supplier performance.
Cost metrics: Manufacturing costs, shipping costs, cost-to-revenue ratios.

## Methodology
Data Loading and Preparation: Load and inspect the dataset, clean data if necessary.
Key Metrics Calculation: Inventory turnover, supplier performance, cost-to-revenue ratio.
Predictive Analytics: Build a Random Forest model to predict product demand.
Optimization: Calculate Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) to optimize inventory levels.
Segmentation: Apply K-Means clustering to segment suppliers based on performance and cost efficiency.

## Key Findings
Supplier Performance: Suppliers in Delhi and Chennai perform the best in terms of lead time and defect rates.
Cost Efficiency: High-cost products are found in Delhi, while Mumbai has more cost-efficient products.
Inventory Turnover: High-turnover products like skincare need consistent restocking, while low-turnover products should reduce stock levels.
Demand Forecasting: The initial predictive model had room for improvement, suggesting the need for additional features such as seasonality.
